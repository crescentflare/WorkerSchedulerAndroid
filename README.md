# WorkerSchedulerAndroid

Schedule and control the worker thread pool more easily.


### Integration guide

When using gradle, the library can easily be imported into the build.gradle file of your project. Add the following dependency:

    implementation 'com.crescentflare.workerscheduler:WorkerSchedulerLib:0.5.0'

Make sure that jcenter is added as a repository.


### Status

This library is old and development is discontinued. Most of the functionality can be replaced by Kotlin or other libraries like [RetroFit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) or [BitletSynchronizer](https://github.com/crescentflare/BitletSynchronizer) (if it's used for API calls).
